Immunization Tracking Marketing Page for WebPT6

Pitch: As a parent, it's hard to keep track of your child's immunization records! Especially if you move states, or switch doctors.  It's a pain to call around and figure out which immunizations your child still needs, or to have them mail you proof for things like school registration.  As an adult, it's even harder to access these records for travel that requires immunizations or booster shots. This app allows medical professionals to upload immunization records to your personal or family account.
